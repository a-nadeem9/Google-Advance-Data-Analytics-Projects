# Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate Projects

Hello there! Welcome to my repository showcasing the projects I completed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera. This certificate program consists of six courses, each offering hands-on projects to apply the skills I learned.

## 1. Foundations of Data Science

In the 'Foundations of Data Science' course, I explored core data science principles and their real-world applications. Gaining insights into diverse industries relying on advanced analytics, I understood data analysis' crucial role in decision-making. Moreover, I learned about data privacy and ethics, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

### ðŸŸ¡  Project: [Automatidata Project Proposal](./Automatidata-Project-Proposal.pdf)
In this project, I showcased an effective data science workflow by creating a project proposal. The proposal communicated essential project tasks and milestones to my team. Utilizing the PACE strategy document as my guide, I ensured efficient project planning and development for successful data science project execution.

## 2. Get Started with Python

In the "Get Started with Python" course, I explored essential Python programming fundamentals for data tasks, covering syntax, semantics, loops, control statements, string manipulation, and data structures.

### ðŸŸ   Project: [Automatidata - Exploring New York City TLC Data](./Automatidata_NYC_TLC)
In this project, I analyzed the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) data. The goal was to identify key variables, ensure data readiness, and derive clear insights for data-based solutions. 

## 3. Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights

During the this course, I honed the art of translating data into meaningful insights. I learned the EDA process for valuable information extraction, the benefits of data structuring and cleaning, and gained hands-on experience in Python-based data exploration. Furthermore, I became proficient in data visualization with Tableau, crafting impactful visualizations to effectively convey insights.

### ðŸ”´  Project: [NYC TLC EDA: Insights for Taxi Ridership](./NYC_TLC_Data_Exploration_Project)

The goal of the project was to uncover valuable insights into NYC taxi ridership through EDA and data visualization, create Python notebook with structured data, engaging matplotlib/seaborn visuals, and an inclusive Tableau dashboard for NYC TLC's informed decisions and data-driven solutions.
