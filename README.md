In the 'Foundations of Data Science' course, I explored core data science principles and their real-world applications. Gaining insights into diverse industries relying on advanced analytics, I understood data analysis' crucial role in decision-making. Moreover, I learned about data privacy and ethics, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
